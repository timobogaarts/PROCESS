# The `Optimise` layer — design

**Status: built.** This was the design-and-measurement record for wiring PROCESS's
constraints, objective and iteration variables into a real `cottax.problem.Optimise` over
the driven graph, and for choosing/benchmarking the SQP driver around it
(`functional_process/sand.py`, `core/solver/drivers.py`, `sand_harness.py`,
`run_sand_harness.py`, `test_sand.py`, `mdf.py`). All of it landed. The port's SQP driver
reproduces PROCESS's answers on the tracked configurations (see `unit_registry.md` /
`next_steps.md` for current per-configuration status) and is measured at roughly 9-12x
PROCESS's wall clock end-to-end and ~180x per iteration, with exact forward-mode
gradients replacing PROCESS's finite differences.

This file grew to 12,000+ lines of investigation across dozens of numbered sections while
that was being worked out — SAND vs. MDF, driver choice, jit/compile strategy, a long
chase of one stellarator configuration's solve instability, and a kink-smoothing retune.
None of that narrative is needed to use or extend the driver layer today. What is worth
keeping — the specific things tried and rejected, with the numbers that killed them, so
nobody re-spends the time re-deriving them — has been extracted to
`_audit/tried_and_rejected.md`. The full investigation, section by section, remains in
git history (`git show be7756fc:functional_process/_audit/optimise_design.md` and its
ancestors, or `git log -- functional_process/_audit/optimise_design.md`); this file's
sections are cited by number from many code comments and other audit records, and none of
that numbering has been changed by this cut — it is simply no longer reproduced here.
